Project Introduction:

Objective: This Python project aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset provided by ABC company, containing detailed information about its employees. The key objectives included:

# Exploratory data analysis
EDA is a vital step in the data analysis process that entails visually and statistically analyzing datasets to find patterns, trends, and insights.

The principal goals of exploratory data analysis (EDA) are to detect anomalies in the dataset and develop recommendations for additional investigation, thereby guaranteeing a thorough comprehension of the subtleties of the data.

EDA provides insightful information that helps with hypothesis creation and decision-making by improving knowledge of data distribution, variable correlations, and anomalies. When all is said and done, the efficacy of data-driven projects is enhanced by EDAâ€™s capacity to identify trends and anomalies.

## Data preprocessing:
When referring to data preparation and cleaning, preprocessing is done before raw data is entered into an analytical tool or machine learning model. Missing value handling, feature scaling, categorical variable encoding, and outlier removal are all part of it. To improve the performance and interpretability of the model, it is important to make sure the data is in the right format. Data-driven jobs are more successful overall when preprocessing is used to reduce noise, standardize data, and optimize it for effective analysis.

1:importing required libraries:numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn 2:missing-data handling(rectified the variable "Height" to "date" and add column "height" with random numbers within the range of 150 to 180)

## Data cleaning:
Data cleaning refers to the process of removing unwanted variables and values from our dataset and getting rid of any irregularities in it.such irregularities can disproportionality skew our data and hence adversely effect the result

## Position segregation:
count number of position have in the dataset,and calculate employee count in each position 2:visualisation of position distribution using countplot for best insight

## Age Group identification:
to identify predominant age group among employees 2:visualisation of corresponding distribution

## Salary analysis:
by bivaraite analysis,determine the team and position of employees with highest salary spending 2:visualisation salary distribution by using scatterplot

## Correlation between Age and SALARY:
Explored the relationship between employees' age and their corresponding salaries.
Presented discovered correlations through heatmaps for clear visualization.

## correlation:
Values close to +1 indicates strong positive correlation, -1 indicates a strong negative correlation and 0 indicates suggests no linear correlation. Darker colors signify strong correlation, while light colors represents weaker correlations. Positive correlation variable move in same directions. As one increases, the other also increases. Negative correlation variable move in opposite directions. An increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other.

## conclusion:
In summary, The analysis provided valuable insights into various aspects including team distributions, salary expenditures across different positions, demographics concerning employee age, and correlations between age and salary within the ABC company. These findings significantly contribute to understanding the internal dynamics and resource allocation of the organization
